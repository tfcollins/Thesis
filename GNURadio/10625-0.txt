[Transcriber’s Note:

This text includes characters that require UTF-8 (Unicode) file
encoding:

  Ȝ ȝ (yogh)
  œ ǽ (oe ligature, æ with accent)
  āēīōū (letters with macron or “long” mark)
  ăĕĭŏŭ (letters with breve or “short” mark)
  ἄβυσσος, μοναχός (Greek)

Yogh is used in dictionary headwords; the others occur only in
etymologies.

If any of these characters do not display properly--in particular, if
the diacritic does not appear directly above the letter--or if the
apostrophes and quotation marks in this paragraph appear as garbage,
make sure your text reader’s “character set” or “file encoding” is set
to Unicode (UTF-8). You may also need to change the default font.

Significant typographical errors are noted as they occur. Other
errors--chiefly in punctuation and abbreviations--are listed at the
end of the e-text, along with an explanation of line-end hyphens.

Unless otherwise noted, words are spelled and alphabetized as
originally printed. Note in particular:

  The letter Æ/æ is alphabetized as “ae”.
  The letter I is alphabetized according to its phonetic value,
    vowel before consonant. J is not used.
  Thorn Þ/þ and eth ð (capital Ð does not occur) are alphabetized
    as “th”.
  The letters U and V are shown with the _form_ used in their source
    documents, but are _alphabetized_ by phonetic value. A few
    sequences such as initial “Su-” do not make this distinction.
  Yogh Ȝ/ȝ is alphabetized after “y”.

Changes given in the authors’ Additions and Corrections have been made
in the main text. New entries are noted with [[Addition]] at the end of
the entry; additions to existing entries have [[Addition:]] at the
beginning of the new material.

All cross-references are shown as printed. Where necessary, corrections
are given in [[double brackets]] at the end of the entry or as a
separate paragraph. The notation “headword spelled +Mous+” means that
the referenced form exists but is not the primary entry; “error for
+Mous+” means that the spelling in the cross-reference is not used.

PREFACE

(+By Professor Skeat+.)

The present work is intended to meet, in some measure, the requirements
of those who wish to make some study of Middle-English, and who find a
difficulty in obtaining such assistance as will enable them to find out
the meanings and etymologies of the words most essential to their
purpose.

The best Middle-English Dictionary, that by Dr. Mätzner of Berlin, has
only reached the end of the letter H; and it is probable that it will
not be completed for many years. The only Middle-English Dictionary that
has been carried on to the end of the alphabet is that by the late Dr.
Stratmann, of Krefeld. This is a valuable work, and is indispensable for
the more advanced student. However, the present work will still supply a
deficiency, as it differs from Stratmann’s Dictionary in many
particulars. We have chosen as our Main Words, where possible, the most
typical of the forms or spellings of the period of Chaucer and Piers
Plowman; in Stratmann, on the other hand, the form chosen as Main Word
is generally the oldest form in which it appears, frequently one of the
twelfth century. Moreover, with regard to authorities, we refer in the
case of the great majority of our forms to a few, cheap, easily
accessible works, whereas Stratmann’s authorities are mainly the
numerous and expensive publications of the Early English Text Society.
Lastly, we have paid special attention to the French element in
Middle-English, whereas Stratmann is somewhat deficient in respect of
words of French origin[1]. The book which has generally been found of
most assistance to the learner is probably Halliwell’s Dictionary of
Archaic and Provincial Words; but this is not specially confined to the
Middle-English period, and the plan of it differs in several respects
from that of the present work.

    [Footnote 1: A new and thoroughly revised edition of Stratmann’s
    Dictionary is being prepared by Mr. Henry Bradley, for the
    Delegates of the Clarendon Press.]

The scope of this volume will be best understood by an explanation of
the circumstances that gave rise to it. Some useful and comparatively
inexpensive volumes illustrative of the Middle-English period have been
issued by the Clarendon Press; all of which are furnished with
glossaries, explaining all the important words, with exact references to
the passages wherein the words occur. In particular, the three useful
hand-books containing Specimens of English (from 1150 down to 1580)
together supply no less than sixty-seven characteristic extracts from
the most important literary monuments of this period; and the three
glossaries to these books together fill more than 370 pages of
closely-printed type in double columns. The idea suggested itself that
it would be highly desirable to bring the very useful information thus
already collected _under one alphabet_, and this has now been effected.
At the same time, a reference has in every case been carefully given to
the _particular_ Glossarial Index which registers each form here cited,
so that it is perfectly easy for any one who consults our book to refer,
not merely to the particular Index thus noted, but to the references
given in that Index; and so, by means of such references, to find every
passage referred to, with its proper context. Moreover the student only
requires, for this purpose, a small array of the text-books in the
Clarendon Press Series, instead of a more or less complete set of
editions of Middle-English texts, the possession of which necessitates a
considerable outlay of money. By this plan, so great a _compression_ of
information has been achieved, that a large number of the articles give
a summary such as can be readily expanded to a considerable length, by
the exercise of a very little trouble; and thus the work is practically
as full of material as if it had been three or four times its present
size. A couple of examples will shew what this really means.

At p. 26 is the following entry:--

‘+Bi-heste+, _sb._ promise, S, S2, C2, P; +byheste+, S2; +beheste+, S2;
+byhest+, S2; +bihese+, S; +biheest+, W; +bihese+, _pl._, S.--AS.
_be-hǽs_.’

By referring to the respective indexes here cited, such as S (= Glossary
to Specimens of English, Part I), and the like, we easily expand this
article into the following:--

‘+Bi-heste+, _sb._ promise, S (9. 19); S2 (1a. 184); C2 (B 37, 41, 42,
F 698); P (3. 126); +byheste+, S2 (18b. 25); +beheste+, S2 (14a. 3);
+byhest+, S2 (12. 57, 18b. 9, [where it may also be explained by
_grant_]); +bihese+, S (where it is used as a plural); +biheest+, W
(promise, command, Lk. xxiv. 49, Rom. iv. 13; pl. _biheestis_, Heb. xi.
13); +bihese+, S (_pl._ behests, promises, 4d. 55).--AS. _behǽs_.’

In order to exhibit the full meaning of this--which requires no further
explanation to those who have in hand the books denoted by S, S2,
&c.--it would be necessary to print the article at considerable length,
as follows:--

‘+Biheste+, _sb._ promise; “dusi _biheste_” a foolish promise, (extract
from) Ancren Riwle, l. 19; “and wel lute wule hulde þe _biheste_ þat he
nom,” (extract from) Robert of Gloucester, l. 184; “holdeth your
_biheste_,” Chaucer, Introd. to Man of Law’s Prologue, l. 37; “_biheste_
is dette,” same, l. 41; “al my _biheste_” same, l. 42; “or breken his
_biheste_” Chaucer, sequel to Squieres Tale, l. 698; “þorw fals
_biheste_,” Piers Plowman, Text B, Pass. iii, l. 126; “to vol-vulle
(fulfil) þat _byheste_” Trevisa (extract from), lib. vi. cap. 29, l. 25;
“the lond of promyssioun, or of _beheste_,” Prol. to Mandeville’s
Travels, l. 3; “wiþ fair _by-hest_,” William and the Werwolf, l. 57; “þe
_byhest_ (promise, _or_ grant) of oþere menne kyngdom,” Trevisa, lib.
vi. cap. 29, l. 9; “y schal sende the _biheest_ of my fadir in-to ȝou,”
Wyclif, Luke xxiv. 49; “not bi the lawe is _biheest_ to Abraham,” Wycl.
Rom. iv. 13; “whanne the _biheestis_ weren not takun,” Wycl. Heb. xi.
13; “longenge to godes _bihese_” Old Eng. Homilies, Dominica iv. post
Pascha, l. 55.’

We thus obtain fifteen excellent examples of the use of this word, with
the full context and an exact reference (easily verified) in every case.
And, in the above instance, all the quotations lie within the compass of
the eleven texts in the Clarendon Press Series denoted, respectively, by
S, S2, S3, C, C2, C3, W, W2, P, H, and G.

The original design was to make use of these text-books only; but it was
so easy to extend it by including examples to be obtained from other
Glossaries and Dictionaries, that a considerable selection of
interesting words was added from these, mainly for the sake of
illustrating the words in the Clarendon text-books. These illustrative
words can be fully or partially verified by those who happen to possess
all or some of the works cited, or they can safely be taken on trust, as
really occurring there, any mistake being due to such authority.

A second example will make this clearer. ‘+Brant+, _adj._ steep, high,
MD, HD; +brent+, JD; +brentest+, _superl._ S2.--AS. _brant_ (_bront_);
cp. Swed. _brant_, Icel. _brattr_.’

Omitting the etymology, the above information is given in two short
lines. Those who possess the ‘Specimens of English’ will easily find the
example of the superl. _brentest_. By consulting Mätzner’s, Halliwell’s,
and Jamieson’s Dictionaries, further information can be obtained, and
the full article will appear as follows:--

‘+Brant+, _adj._ steep, high, MD [+brant+, +brent+, _adj._ ags. _brand_,
arduus, altus, altn. _brattr_, altschw. _branter_, schw. _brant_,
_bratt_, dän, _brat_, sch. _brent_, nordengl. Diall. _brant_: cf.
“_brant_, steepe,” Manipulus Vocabulorum, p. 25: steil, hoch.--“Apon the
bald Bucifelon _brant_ up he sittes,” King Alexander, ed. Stevenson,
p. 124; “Thir mountaynes ware als _brant_ upritȝe as thay had bene
walles,” MS. quoted in Halliwell’s Dict., p. 206; “Hyȝe bonkkes &
_brent_,” Gawain and the Grene Knight, l. 2165; “Bowed to þe hyȝ bonk
þer _brentest_ hit wern,” Alliterative Poems, ed. Morris, Poem B,
l. 379]; HD [+brant+, steep. _North_: “Brant against Flodden Hill,”
explained by Nares from Ascham, “up the steep side;” cf. Brit. Bibl. i.
132, same as _brandly_?--“And thane thay com tille wonder heghe
mountaynes, and it semed as the toppes had towched the firmament; and
thir mountaynes were als _brant_ upriȝte as thay had bene walles, so
that ther was na clymbyng upon thame,” Life of Alexander, MS. Lincoln,
fol. 38]; JD [+brent+, _adj._ high, straight, upright; “My bak, that
sumtyme _brent_ hes bene, Now cruikis lyk are camok tre,” Maitland
Poems, p. 193; _followed by a discussion extending to more than 160
lines of small print, which we forbear to quote_]; +brentest+, _superl._
S2. 13. 379 [“And bowed to þe hyȝ bonk þer _brentest_ hit were (MS.
wern),” Allit. Poems, l. 379; _already cited in_ Mätzner, _above_].’

The work, in fact, contains a very large collection of words, in many
variant forms, appearing in English literature and in Glossaries between
A.D. 1150 and A.D. 1580. The glossaries in S2, S3 (Specimens of English,
1298-1393, and 1394-1579) have furnished a considerable number of words
belonging to the Scottish dialect, which most dictionaries (excepting of
course that of Jamieson) omit.

The words are so arranged that even the beginner will, in general,
easily find what he wants. We have included in one article, together
with the Main Word, all the variant spellings of the glossaries, as well
as the etymological information. We have also given in alphabetical
order numerous cross-references to facilitate the finding of most of the
variant forms, and to connect them with the Main Word. In this way, the
arrangement is at once etymological and alphabetical--adapted to the
needs of the student of the language and of the student of the
literature.

The meanings of the words are given in modern English, directly after
the Main Word. The variant forms, as given in their alphabetical
position, are frequently also explained, thus saving (in such cases) the
trouble of a cross-reference, if the meaning of the word is alone
required.

An attempt is made in most cases to give the etymology, so far at least
as to shew the immediate source of the Middle-English word. Especial
pains have been taken with the words of French origin, which form so
large a portion of the vocabulary of the Middle-English period. In many
cases the AF (Anglo-French) forms are cited, from my list of English
Words found in Anglo-French, as published for the Philological Society
in 1882.

The student of English who wishes to trace back the history of a word
still in use can, in general, find the Middle-English form in Skeat’s
Etymological Dictionary, and will then be able to consult the present
work in order to obtain further instances of its early use.

The relative share of the authors in the preparation of this work is
easily explained. The whole of it in its present form (with the
exception of the letter N) was compiled, prepared, and written out for
press by Mr. Mayhew. The original plan was, however, my own; and I began
by writing out the letter N (since augmented) by way of experiment and
model. It will thus be seen that Mr. Mayhew’s share of the work has been
incomparably the larger, involving all that is most laborious. On the
other hand, I may claim that much of the labour was mine also, at a much
earlier stage, as having originally compiled or revised the glossaries
marked S2, S3, C2, C3, W, W2, P, and G, as well as the very full
glossarial indexes cited as B, PP, and WA, and the dictionary cited as
SkD. The important glossary marked S was, however, originally the work
of Dr. Morris (since re-written by Mr. Mayhew), and may, in a sense, be
said to be the back-bone of the whole, from its supplying a very large
number of the most curious and important early forms.

The material used has been carefully revised by both authors, so that
they must be held to be jointly responsible for the final form in which
the whole is now offered to the public.


NOTE ON THE PHONOLOGY OF MIDDLE-ENGLISH.

One great difficulty in finding a Middle-English word in this, or any
other, Dictionary is due to the frequent variation of the symbols
denoting the vowel-sounds. Throughout the whole of the period to which
the work relates the symbols _i_ and _y_, in particular, are constantly
interchanged, whether they stand alone, or form parts of diphthongs.
Consequently, words which are spelt with one of these symbols in a given
text must frequently be looked for as if spelt with the other; i.e. the
pairs of symbols _i_ and _y_, _ai_ and _ay_, _ei_ and _ey_, _oi_ and
_oy_, _ui_ and _uy_, must be looked upon as likely to be used
indifferently, one for the other. For further information, the student
should consult the remarks upon Phonology in the Specimens of English
(1150 to 1300), 2nd ed., p. xxv. For those who have not time or
opportunity to do this, a few brief notes may perhaps suffice.

The following symbols are frequently confused, or are employed as
equivalent to each other because they result from the same sound in the
Oldest English or in Anglo-French:--

  _i_, _y_;--_ai_, _ay_;--_ei_, _ey_;--_oi_, _oy_;--_ui_, _uy_.

  _a_, _o_;--_a_, _æ_, _e_, _ea_;--
  _e_, _eo_, _ie_;--_o_, _u_, _ou_;--(all originally short).

  _a_, _æ_, _ea_, _e_, _ee_;--_e_, _ee_, _eo_, _ie_;--
  _o_, _oo_, _oa_;--_u_, _ou_, _ui_;--(all long).

These are the most usual interchanges of symbols, and will commonly
suffice for practical purposes, in cases where the cross-references
fail. If the word be not found after such substitutions have been
allowed for, it may be taken for granted that the Dictionary does not
contain it. As a fact, the Dictionary only contains a considerable
number of such words as are most common, or (for some special reason)
deserve notice; and it is at once conceded that it is but a small
hand-book, which does not pretend to exhibit in all its fulness the
extraordinarily copious vocabulary of our language at an important
period of its history. The student wishing for complete information will
find (in course of time) that the New English Dictionary which is being
brought out by the Clarendon Press will contain all words found in our
literature since the year 1100.

Of course variations in the vowel-sounds are also introduced, in the
case of strong verbs, by the usual ‘gradation’ due to their method of
conjugation. To meet this difficulty in some measure, numerous (but not
exhaustive) cross-references have been introduced, as when, e.g. ‘+Bar+,
bare’ is given, with a cross-reference to +Beren+. Further help in this
respect is to be had from the table of 183 strong verbs given at pp.
lxix-lxxxi of the Preface to Part I of the Specimens of English (2nd
edition); see, in particular, the alphabetical index to the same, at pp.
lxxxi, lxxxii. The same Preface further contains some account of the
three principal Middle-English dialects (p. xl), and Outlines of the
Grammar (p. xlv). It also explains the meaning of the symbols þ, ð (both
used for _th_), ȝ (used for _y_ initially, _gh_ medially, and _gh_ or
_z_ finally), with other necessary information.

SYMBOLS.

In the etymological part three stops are used as symbols in connexion
with the cognate forms cited, namely the comma, the semi-colon, and the
colon. The comma is used to connect various spellings of a word, as well
as parallel forms cited from nearly connected languages; for instance,
s.v. +daunger+, the OF. forms are so connected. The semi-colon between
two forms denotes that the two forms are phonetically equivalent, and
that the preceding one is directly derived from, and is historically
connected with the one following this symbol; for instance, s.v.
+bugle+, the OF. _bugle_ is the phonetic equivalent of the Lat.
_buculum_, and is immediately derived therefrom. The colon between two
forms denotes that the two forms are phonetically equivalent, and that
the form following this symbol is an earlier, more primitive form than
the one preceding, without an immediate interborrowing between the
languages being asserted; for instance, s.v. +demen+, the Goth. _dómjan_
is an older form than the AS. _déman_, but _déman_ is not borrowed from
the Gothic. The abbreviation ‘cp.’ introduces other cognate forms, and
has the same value as the symbol + in Skeat’s Dictionaries.

The asterisk * at the beginning of a word denotes a theoretical form,
assumed (upon scientific principles) to have formerly existed. The sign
= is to be read ‘a translation of.’ ‘(_n_)’ after Prompt., Cath. and
other authorities refers to foot-notes or other notes citing the form in
question.

[[Addition:]] Dr. F. Holthausen suggests that this word means ‘danger,
peril,’ comparing this ME. _hagt_ with Icel. _hætta_ which has the same
meaning. Kluge connects this _hætta_ with Gothic _hāhan_, to hang, so
that it may mean radically ‘a state of being in suspense.’ The word must
have come into England in the form *_haht_, before the assimilation of
_ht_ to _tt_.

+Bye+, _v._ to buy, S2; +by+, C3; see +Biggen+.

+Camel.+ The regular OF. equivalent for Lat. _camēlum_ was _chameil_. In
OF. _camel_ the termination _-el_ is due to analogy with French forms
derived from _-ālem_. See BH, § 43.

+Canoun.+ Church Lat. _canonicus_ did not mean originally ‘one on the
church-roll or list,’ but one who was bound to observe a certain rule of
life (_canon_, κανών). OF. _chanoine_ is not the precise equivalent of
_canonicum_, but represents a Latin type *_canonium_. See Scheler’s
Dict. (ed. 3).

  [[Error for _For_ ... _read_ ...]]

+Dide+, _pt. s._ did, caused, put, S; see +Don+.

+Dilitable+, _adj._ delightful, S2; see +Delitable+.

+Diuise+, _v._ to tell of, describe, S2; see +Deuisen+.

+Druiȝest+, _2 pr. s._ art dry, S2; see +Drye+.

+Dunt+, _sb._ blow, S, S2; see +Dent+.

+Effnenn+, _v._ to make equal or even, S; see +Euenen+.

+Ernes.+ A derivation of this word from the French has not been
proved.--OF. _ernes_ does not exist.

+Falten.+ The form +falt+ should be taken away from this article and
placed under +Folden+. The words _falt mi tunge_ mean ‘my tongue gives
way.’ For the various meanings of this verb +folden+, see MD (ii. 68).
This correction is due to the kindness of Prof. Napier.

+For-swinken+, _v._ to exhaust with toil; +forswonke+, _pp._, S3
(p. 364, l. 24).

+Frayd+, _pp._ frightened, S3; +fraid+, scared, S3; see +Afrayen+.

+Habide+, _v._ to abide, resist, S2; see +A-biden+.

+Hagt.+ Dr. F. Holthausen suggests that this word means ‘danger, peril,’
comparing this ME. _hagt_ with Icel. _hætta_ which has the same meaning.
Kluge connects this _hætta_ with Gothic _hāhan_, to hang, so that it may
mean radically ‘a state of being in suspense.’ The word must have come
into England in the form *_haht_, before the assimilation of _ht_ to
_tt_.

+Hal+, _adj._ all, S2; see +Al+.

+Ham+, _1 pr. s._ am, S; see +Am+.

+Haxede+, _pt. s._ asked, S; see +Asken+.

+Here+, _adv._ before, S; see +Er+.

+Heremyte+, _sb._ hermit, S2; +heremites+, _pl._, P; see +Ermite+.

+Hulpen.+ (To be placed more to the right.)

+Ich+, _adj._ each, S, S2; see +Eche+.

+Ieden+, _pt. pl._ went, S; see +Eode+.

+Joutes.+ For _jutā_ read _jūta_. For other cognates of this wide-spread
word, see Kluge (s.v. _jauche_). See also s.v. _käse_, where Kluge
remarks that Icel. _ostr_, cheese, and Finnish _juusto_, cheese, are
etymologically connected with G. _jauche_, and Latin _jus_.

+Kepen.+ AS. _cépan_, to keep, should be kept quite distinct from AS.
_cýpan_, to sell. AS. _cýpan_ is the phonetic representative of OTeut.
_kaupjan_, whereas _cépan_, to keep, represents an OTeut. *_kōpjan_. Cp.
E. _keen_, the representative of AS. _céne_, OTeut. *_kōni_ (G. _kühn_).
See Kluge’s note in P. & B. Beiträge, viii. 538.

+Mo.+ Add ) at the end.

+Note+, _sb._ nut. A better explanation of _not-heed_ is ‘with the hair
of the head closely cut.’ The verb to _nott_ means to cut the hair
close. ‘_Tondre_, to sheer, clip, cut, powle, _nott_’; Cotgrave.

+Onond+, _prep._ as regards, respecting, S; +onont+, S; see +An-ent+.

+Quene.+ It should be noted that E. _queen_ is not precisely the same
word as E. _quean_. For _queen_ is the phonetic equivalent of AS.
_cwén_, Goth. _kwēns_, whereas _quean_ represents AS. _cwĕne_, Goth.
_kwĭno_.

+Senged+, _pp._ sun-burnt, S3 (p. 364, l. 29); see +Sengin+.

+Sisour+, _sb._ juror, PP; +sysour+, P; see +Asisour+.

+Stok.+ Prof. Napier maintains that the +stokess+ of the Ormulum cannot
be identified with AS. _stocc_, as the gemination of the consonant
persists in the Ormulum. He suggests that +stokess+ means ‘places,’
comparing the use of _stoke_ in place-names, e.g. _Wude stoke_ in Chron.
(Earle, p. 249), He also cites in illustration AS. _stoc-weard_,
‘oppidanus,’ see Leo, p. 206.

+Sum+ (1). _Dele_ ‘+sumere+, dat., S;’

+Twichand+, _pres. pt._ touching, regarding, S3 (13. 271).

+Tyred+, _pp._ attired, dressed, S2; see +Atyren+.

+Urþe+ (written +Vrþe+), _sb._ earth, S2; see +Erthe+.

+Whicche+, a chest, trunk, box; +whucche+, PP; +whyche+, Prompt.;
+hoche+, Prompt.--AS. _hwicce_; ‘Clustella, _hwicce_;’ Engl. Studien,
xi. 65.

+Wike+, _sb. pl._ the corners of the mouth, S (4 a. 49).--Cf. Icel.
_munnvik_, pl., the corners of the mouth; see CV (s.v. _munnr_). The
word _wikes_ is still in use in this sense at Whitby. See Whitby
Glossary (E.D.S.).

+Wone+, _adj._ one, S3 (7. 97); see +Oon+.

+Wyne-grapis+, _sb. pl._ vine-grapes, S3 (13. 99).

ERRORS AND INCONSISTENCIES

Misprinted words or letters are extremely rare. Significant errors were
noted at the point of occurrence.

Variations in source and language abbreviations such as “O.H.G.” for
“OHG.” have been regularized to the forms given in the Authorities and
Language lists. Errors in Greek accents were silently corrected. A few
minor variations were retained, including:

  “hedgehog” and “hedghog”
  (_n_) or (_n._)
  _pt. pr._ or _pt.-pr._

The word “invisible” means that there is an appropriately sized blank
space in the printed text.

Cross-References

As noted at the beginning of the e-text, errors in cross-references are
shown in [[double brackets]] at the end of the entry. Most errors are
minor lapses in editing, such as adding or omitting a final “e” or
“n” (in verbs), or forgetting that the text does not use the letter “J”.
More serious errors, such as references to words that could not be found
in the Dictionary, are explained in separate paragraphs.


Typographical Errors

Listed here are minor errors such as missing, incorrect or superfluous
punctuation, or mistakes in typesetting such as wrong italics. More
substantive errors were noted in [[double brackets]] within the main
text.

HYPHENS AT LINE-END

The book’s two-column format resulted in a great many line-end hyphens.
Most hyphenated words were unique, so the ordinary tests (“Is this word,
or a structurally similar one, hyphenated on its other occurrences?”)
could seldom be used.

Line-end hyphens in cross-references (“see”, “see also”, “cf.”) were
kept or omitted based on the form of the cross-referenced headword. Note
that hyphenization in this situation is very inconsistent. Except in the
Additions, cross-references often omit a mid-line hyphen that is present
in the referenced word, or include one that is absent.

Line-end hyphens were retained in past participles in i-, y- and
equivalent, and after the prefixes out- (owt-) and to-; they were
removed before common endings such as -lich (-like, -ly), -s(c)hip,
-ness, -full. They were removed after Middle English un-, but retained
after Anglo-Saxon un-.

The remaining line-end hyphens were omitted _unless_ they were in the
same location (morphological boundary) as the hyphen in the headword,
or if the hyphenated word was a compound. Within these two groups, final
decisions were based on more fluid criteria such as internal consistency
within an entry, or hyphenization of other words from the same source.
These ambiguous hyphens are listed below.

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
